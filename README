WWW/Scraper/ISBN version 0.21
=============================

The WWW::Scraper::ISBN class was built as a way to retrieve information on books from multiple sources
easily.  It utilizes at least one driver implemented as a subclass of L<WWW::Scraper::ISBN::Driver>, each of
which is designed to scrape from a single source.  Because we found that different sources had different
information available on different books, we designed a basic interface that could be implemented in
whatever ways necessary to retrieve the desired information.

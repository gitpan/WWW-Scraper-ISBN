WWW-Scraper-ISBN
================

The WWW::Scraper::ISBN class was built as a way to retrieve information on 
books from multiple online sources easily. It utilizes at least one driver 
implemented as a subclass of L<WWW::Scraper::ISBN::Driver>, each of which is 
designed to scrape from a single source.  Because we found that different 
sources had different information available on different books, we designed a 
basic interface that could be implemented in whatever ways necessary to 
retrieve the desired information.
